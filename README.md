# ReshadeFX LSP

## Very very WIP and I'm a novice coder

I wanted to create this project so that I could more easily write my own
ReShade shaders as I found out there's not really any proper extension
for it for VSCode nor a language server that I could find, and it also
serves as a vehicle for me to learn more programming, as I mostly only
work on scripting and system administration for my work and my
homelab-esque hobbies.
